# Basic Learning Management System (LMS)

## Project Overview

This is a basic Learning Management System (LMS) prototype that allows users to enroll in courses, track their progress, and access video content. Users can watch embedded video lessons, mark lessons as completed, and manage their profile with a basic user authentication system.

## Features

- **User Enrollment**: Users can enroll in courses and track their progress (0% to 100% completion).
- **Course Content**: Each course has video lessons that can be watched directly from the application.
- **Video Integration**: Uses AWS S3 for storing and retrieving video content securely.
- **User Authentication**: Basic user registration and login system.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL for storing course, user, and enrollment data.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for courses by title or description.
